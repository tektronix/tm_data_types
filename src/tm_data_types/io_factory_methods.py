    Process Overview:
        1. Lookup Table: The method begins by using a lookup table to determine the behavior based on the
                         waveform type.
        2. Formatting: The waveform is formatted according to its type.
        3. Writing: Finally, the formatted waveform is written to the specified file path.

    Special Cases:
        - RawSample Type: No transformations are applied when saving data in the `.wfm`
                          format, if the waveform is of the [`RawSample`][tm_data_types.RawSample] type.
                          This is done to ensure that `.wfm` files are saved and loaded as quickly as possible.
        - Normalized Type: If the waveform is of the [`Normalized`][tm_data_types.datum.data_types.Normalized] type,
                           a transformation is performed because `.wfm` files must contain digitized data,
                           with spacing and offset stored separately.

    Args:
        path: The path file to write to.
        waveform: The waveform that is being written.
        product: The product being written to.
        file_format: A specialized file format we are writing as.

        2. Type Detection: The method reads small sections of the file to identify the waveform type.
        3. Reformatting: The waveform is read and returned in the appropriate format,

    Special Cases:
        - All waveforms are returned in the [`RawSample`][tm_data_types.RawSample] format.
          The data is reformatted for compatibility with the oscilloscope, which involves
          mathematical transformations on the entire dataset.
